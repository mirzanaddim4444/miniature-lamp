# Source Hashes in Stack Traces

Authors: [Rob Paveza](https://github.com/robpaveza)

## Status of this Document
This document is a proposed enhancement to V8 in the area of JavaScript stack traces, which is today specifically not a Web Standard.

* This document status: **Active** (One-pager)
* Expected venue: [V8-dev](https://groups.google.com/g/v8-dev)
* **Current version: this document**
* Prototype [implementation](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/3229957) in V8

## Introduction

* Source URLs are often insufficient for uniquely identifying a file in post-hoc debugging scenarios, even when they contain a `# sourceMappingURL=` comment.
* This presents a problem for debugging in production, especially when CI systems might automatically deploy new versions of a source file into a production environment. DevTools might incorrectly load a source map, and there is no way to verify that a source map corresponds to a particular version of a file
* Web developers have come up with many clever ways to handle this - explicitly correlating versions of applications to source maps, or including a CRC as part of a file name - indicating that this is a difficult problem for them.

## Goals

 - Improve ability to resolve a source map from only the source file

## Non-Goals

 - Change the [Source Maps specification](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html)

## Use Cases

 - Diagnostics in production

## Proposed Solution

The hash of source scripts should be accessible when preparing a stack trace or in other locations in which a source file is referenced. This will include, but is not limited to:

 - `CallSite`, exposed in the callback `Error.prepareStackTrace`
 - Some CDP properties:
   - `Runtime.CallFrame`
   - `Debugger.CallFrame`
 - Performance trace embedders for function calls

By leveraging the hash of the source file, a "fingerprint" can be generated which will allow developers to index their source maps according to the hash of the content actually running in the browser.

One drawback of this solution is that non-code changes in source files (such as comments or whitespace) are likely to generate files with identical "result sources." For the most part, however, this should be a solvable problem.

### Appearance within `CallSite`

The hash will be a [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) and encoded in base-16. The following code snippet would append a source hash to the end of each error stack frame:

```ts
(() => {
  let canGetScriptHash = false;
  const oldPrepareStackTrace = Error.prepareStackTrace;
  Error.prepareStackTrace = (er, frames) => {
    if ('getScriptHash' in frames[0].constructor.prototype) {
      canGetScriptHash = true;
    }
    return er.stack;
  };
  const error = new Error();
  // This should invoke prepareStackTrace above.
  const stack = error.stack;
  console.log(`Was able to retrieve hash: ${canGetScriptHash}`);
  if (!canGetScriptHash) {
    Error.prepareStackTrace = oldPrepareStackTrace;
  }
  else {
    Error.prepareStackTrace = (er, frames) => {
      const originalStack = er.stack;
      const lines = originalStack.split('\n');
      let msg = er.name;
      if (er.message) {
        msg = `${er.name}: ${er.message}`;
      }
      const stackLines = lines.slice(1);
      const formattedLines = stackLines.map((f, i) => {
        const frame = frames[i];
        const hash = frame.getScriptHash();
        if (hash) {
          return `${f} [source hash ${hash}]`;
        }
        return f;
      });
      formattedLines.unshift(msg);
      return formattedLines.join('\n');
    };
  }
})();
```

This will produce a stack trace along the following lines:

```
Error: This is an example error.
    at http://localhost:8080/test.js:6:11 [source hash ca119760926fbc8502b445d33dc94c4c34d4ef0f20103909e92f91b17c97f33d]
    at doWork (http://localhost:8080/additional-script.js:2:3) [source hash d91c151b875409add9cd0e19b20230e09610142727b11aa3873c54f0ae8de414]
    at scenario (http://localhost:8080/test.js:4:3) [source hash ca119760926fbc8502b445d33dc94c4c34d4ef0f20103909e92f91b17c97f33d]

```

This is computed entirely in userland, except for the source hash.

## Privacy and Security Considerations

To avoid the possibility that a script might perform some malicious computation based on incoming third-party script hashes, scripts will determine whether they have been loaded as "opaque." "Opaque" is a term of art within V8 that means that details of errors within a script should not be computed due to risks of leaking privacy details. This information is determined by the embedder policy when the `ScriptOrigin` objects are created as part of compiling a script; if the script is loaded as "opaque," then the computation of the hash will opportunistically exit and return an empty string.

For the browser, the result of this will be that classic scripts loaded with CORS can be computed, those loaded without CORS will not be able to be computed, and module scripts, which are always subject to CORS, will always be able to be computed.

## Alternative Solutions

The original alternative explored here was to enable a property on the `Error` object, `stackTraceSourceHash`, to embed the hash directly in the line. This proposal was rejected because the `Error#stack` property is already not standardized, and adding another flag here would create an additional burden to standardize.

Another alternative solution explored here was to enable a callback on the `Error` object, such as:

```ts
Error.stackTraceComputeFingerprint = (sourceContents: Uint8Array) => Promise<string>;
```

Then, if at runtime the `stackTraceComputeFingerprint` function is not present, it can return to the present behavior.

While this seems like a reasonable approach, it seems to be an excessive level of complexity that it's unlikely most customers would override; and, I am concerned that it might introduce cross-origin security issues.
